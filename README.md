## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand a typical use case of customer/user segmentation.  
- Structure a data-driven value generation case in a scenario without a prior hypothesis or specific business request.  
- Apply basic clustering algorithms.  
- Evaluate and compare models. Assess and compare approaches across different data science practitioners.  
- Interpret and communicate the results effectively.

## ðŸ“„ Overview

The company's Marketing team regularly uses email campaigns to engage with potential customers.  
They have approached the Data Science team to identify customer segments based on their interaction with email-based advertising.

> Are there distinct behavioral groups? Are there any useful patterns?

The goal is to interpret and analyze the data, identify any patterns, engineer new features, and train a model that allows for effective user segmentation.

It is essential to analyze and characterize the final clusters, identifying the specific traits of each one.

## âœ… Instructions

You are expected to use clustering techniques to generate business value.

At a minimum, your work should include:

- âœ… Creation of at least one new variable  
- âœ… A clear rationale for selecting the number of clusters  
- âœ… A recommendation for the marketing team

There are no strict boundaries for this analysis â€” you are encouraged to explore and expand as much as needed.
